# ALB Target Types in AWS EKS: Instance vs IP

In AWS EKS, the **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** can route traffic to Kubernetes clusters using two target types:

1. **Instance Target Type**: ALB routes traffic to the **node (instance) IP and port**.
2. **IP Target Type**: ALB routes traffic directly to the **pod IPs**.

## Key Differences Between ALB with Instance and IP Target Types

| **Feature**               | **Instance Target Type**                                           | **IP Target Type**                                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Routing**               | ALB routes traffic to the node (instance) IP.                     | ALB routes traffic directly to pod IPs.                        |
| **Traffic Flow**          | Traffic is forwarded from the node to the target pod using kube-proxy. | ALB skips the node layer and routes directly to pods.           |
| **Performance**           | Slightly slower due to an extra hop (node-to-pod).                | Faster, as traffic directly reaches pods.                      |
| **Pod Scalability**       | Pods are indirectly reachable. Limited by the nodes' capacity.    | Pods scale independently.                                       |
| **Networking**            | Requires nodes to register with the ALB target group.             | Requires pods to have routable IPs (e.g., AWS VPC CNI).         |
| **Use Case**              | Useful for legacy setups or CNIs that don’t support pod IPs.      | Recommended for most modern Kubernetes deployments.             |

## How Traffic Flows

### **1. ALB with Instance Target Type**
1. Incoming traffic reaches the ALB.
2. ALB routes traffic to the node's IP and port.
3. The node forwards traffic to the appropriate pod via **kube-proxy**.

**Workflow:**
```plaintext
[Client] --> [ALB] --> [Node (Instance)] --> [Pod (via kube-proxy)]
```

---

### **2. ALB with IP Target Type**
1. Incoming traffic reaches the ALB.
2. ALB routes traffic directly to the pod IP.

**Workflow:**
```plaintext
[Client] --> [ALB] --> [Pod]
```

## Example Kubernetes Manifests

### **1. ALB with Instance Target Type**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: alb-instance-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "alb"
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: "instance" # Targets the node IP
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: "internet-facing"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

---

### **2. ALB with IP Target Type**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: alb-ip-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "alb"
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: "ip" # Targets pod IPs directly
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: "internet-facing"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

## Use Case Scenarios

### **Instance Target Type**
- **When to Use**:
  - Legacy Kubernetes clusters without a CNI that supports pod-level IP routability.
  - Simpler or compatibility-focused setups.
- **Limitations**:
  - Adds an extra hop (node → pod), which can increase latency.
  - Tied to node scaling; if node capacity is reached, traffic may be throttled.

---

### **IP Target Type**
- **When to Use**:
  - Modern Kubernetes clusters with a CNI like AWS VPC CNI that provides pod-level IPs.
  - Need better performance and scalability (direct routing to pods).
- **Advantages**:
  - Eliminates the extra hop, leading to faster routing.
  - Scales seamlessly with pod autoscaling.

**Conclusion**:
- Use **IP Target Type** for modern Kubernetes deployments where performance and scalability are a priority.
- Use **Instance Target Type** for legacy setups or compatibility scenarios.
